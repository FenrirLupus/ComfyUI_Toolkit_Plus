# ComfyUI Toolkit Plus
A Toolkit of utility-focused extension pack for **ComfyUI**, designed to provide workflow companion tools such as a persistent Prompt Library panel, with room to grow into additional nodes and UI tools over time.
This project focuses on **clarity, control, and non-destructive tooling** for AI-assisted creative workflows.

[WARNING] I am not a Coder I am a Simple Hobbyist Who Loves to Work with AI to Create Various Artwork for My Own Personal Use Therefore the Code Stated and Created in this Project is done with AI Itself in a Relatively Organized Manner Not Everything is Perfect But Any updates I Make May/Will Be Updated Here as I use My own Tools on a Consistent Basis [WARNING]
Regardless I Hope You Enjoy the Pack and It's Features!!

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- **User-controlled**  
  Nothing is injected into workflows without your action.
- **Non-destructive**  
  Your graphs remain untouched.
- **Transparent storage**  
  Prompts are stored as real files you can back up or edit.
  Files are Saved within this Custom Nodes Pack Directory that way Everything is Organized
- **Utility-first**  
  Built to support real creative pipelines, not gimmicks.
